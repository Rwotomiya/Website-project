        <p>Culture can be defined as all the ways of life including arts,
                 beliefs and institutions of a population that are passed down from generation to generation. 
                 Culture has been called "the way of life for an entire society." As such, it includes codes
                  of manners, dress, language, religion, rituals, art. culture has a number of elements which include; 
                  Symbols, Language, Values, Norms, Physical environments.ulture unites people of a single society together
                   through shared beliefs, traditions, and expectations. The two basic types of culture are material culture,
                    physical things produced by a society, and nonmaterial culture, intangible things produced by a society</p>
    <h3 style="font-style:italic;">There are a variety of cultures in the pearl of Africa</h3>
        <p>The cultural legacy of Uganda is a result of its past.Over the years, the country has seen 
        many waves of migration,resulting in a rich mix of  ethnic groups. The region's first 
         occupants were hunter-gatherers who lived there for thousands of years.Over 50 culturally 
         diverse population make the potion of Uganda. These various ethnic groups have their own beliefs,
          culture, traditions,norms and more..Ugandan traditions include folk music, dances, foods,
          clothing, and building styles, among others.In Northern Uganda, particularly the Lango 
          sub-region, a healing ritual called child-cleansing ceremony 
        is conducted to restore the lost manhood of a child.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="grid-item"><h3>The baganda culture</h3>
            <img src="pics/king.jpg" class="images">
            <p>We start with the most common tribe which is the baganda.The Bantu were the earliest group 
                to come to Uganda and constitute over 50 percent of Uganda's total population.  
                 The baganda ethic group of people 
                or simply the ganda people are a group of bantu ethic group in the central uganda. they are composed 
                52 clans although there are only 46 recorgnised. its the largest and most popular in the whole 
                uganda. They are located along the northern and western showers of lake victoria in uganda
                and these peaople speake a language called "luganda".they follow traditions and have cultural dress codes
                the men wear kanzus while the women wear gomesi.</p></div>
        <div class= "grid-item"><h3>Ankole culture</h3>
            <img src="pics/west.jpg"class="images">
            <p>The Nkole or Banyankole are a Bantu ethnic group native to Uganda. They primarily inhabit Ankole.
                 They are closely related to other Bantu peoples of the region, namely the Nyoro, Kiga, Toro and Hema peoples.
                 According to legend, the first (and semi-legendary) king of Ankole, Ruhinda Rwa Njunaki, 
                 was born as the illegitimate son of Wamara (or Ndahura), the last emperor of the Empire of Kitara. 
                 His mother was known as Njunaki and was a servant in the king's palace.
                 Like other Bantu groups, the origins of the Banyankore could be traced to the Congo region.
                  Legends hold that the first occupant of Ankole was Ruhanga (the creator), who is believed to
                   have come from heaven to rule the earth. Ruhanga is believed to have come with his three sons Kairu,
                    Kakama and Kahima</p>
                </div>
        <div class= "grid-item"><h3>Bakiga culture</h3>
            <img src="pics/bakiga.jpg" class="images">
            <p>The Bakiga are very hospitable and enjoy the privilege of having a mixed language. Rukiga, as a language,
                 is a combination of the influence of the accents and alphabets from Rwanda, Ankore, Toro, Bufumbira, 
                 and Swahili. Before the Bakiga were educated about Islam and Christianity, they believed in one God.The 
                 first is that they originally lived in the Kingdom of Karagwe (northwest of today's Tanzania) having migrated
                  from Bunyoro during the Luo invasion and are associated with the Banyambo of Tanzania. Another tradition states 
                  that the cradle of the Bakiga was in Buganza in Rwanda.Whereas the Bakiga and Banyankore have clans with similar
                   names, they are not always the same clans in both nations. Indeed, the Bakiga Clans are the equivalent of Banyankore
                    Roots (ebibunu or ebisintsi.) Bakiga subclans (emiryango) are equivalent to the Banyankore clans.</p></div>
        <div class= "grid-item"><h3>Teso culture</h3>
            <img src="pics/teso.jpg" class="images">
            <p>Teso, people of central Uganda and Kenya who speak Teso (Ateso), an Eastern Sudanic (Nilotic)
            language of the Nilo-Saharan language family. The Teso are counted among the most progressive 
            farmers of Uganda; they quickly took to ox plows when they began cultivating cotton in the early 1900s.
            The Iteso people originate from the Karamojong region living in and near Kidepo Valley National 
            Park in Northeastern Uganda. While they may or may not be direct descendants of the Karamojong,
            they certainly still have strong linguistic and cultural ties to the region.
            The Iteso were a superstitious society and they believed in witchcraft and wizardly. 
            It was a taboo for women to eat chicken. Particular clans had specific taboos, mainly animals 
            they were not permitted to eat. The bush-buck (ederet) was taboo to a number of clans.
            Immediately after birth, a Teso child is given three names. The first name is given according to 
            the prevailing weather conditions, time of the day and farming season. The second name is the child’s
             surname and is given by the father. The third name is the English name and is given by any member of
              the family or friends. After 3 or 4 days, a shaving ceremony is conducted based on the gender of a child
               (3 days for a female and 4 days for a male).</p></div>

            <h3>Acholi culture</h3>
            <img src="pics/acoli.jpg" class="images">
            <p>Acholi live in Northern Uganda, in the districts Kitgum, Pader and Gulu. 
                They are speakers of Western Nilotic languages and are traditionally farmers.
                The majority of Acholi people currently live in Northern Uganda. As of the 2014 census,
                1.4 million Acholi live in the northern part of the country in three districts: Kitgum, 
                Gulu, and Pader. Due to Uganda's continuous civil wars and persecution of the Acholi people,
                their population was greatly reduced. Almost 300,000 Acholi were massacred under the brutal
                regime of Idi Amin in the 1970s.The Acholi people speak the language of Luo. Luo is a 
                Western Nilotic language, a group of languages spoken throughout the northwest Democratic
                Republic of Congo and in Uganda, northern Tanzania, Kenya, western Ethiopia, and South Sudan.</p></div>
        <div class= "grid-item"><h3>The langi</h3>
            <img src="pics/langi.jpg" class="images">
            <p>The Langi are said to have originated from the mountain Otukei and Atwi. 
                These mountains are said to be blessed with abundant rain. The Langi share similar 
                characteristics like the Ateker who are the Eastern Nilotics. The Langi where the final group of 
                migration from Abyssinia in Ethiopia.The Lango are a Nilotic ethnic group.

                District until 1974, when it was split into the districts of Apac and Lira, and subsequently into 
                several additional districts.The Langi dress code is similar that of the Iteso with a Masai shuka 
                skirt and scarf, a Lango feather helmet, Lango sandals, a beads belt and beads/animal skin/leather
                    pockets. A full “Lesu” attire is also worn. The Langi also have small wooden stools similar to those
                    of the Karimojong.The Langi (often referred to as Lango, which is actually the name of their language.
                    Lango also refers to a singular person; Lango person, Langi people) live in Lango sub-region 
                    (politically Northern Region, but geographically central Uganda), north of Lake Kyoga.</p></div>

                       and them acquiring Lugbrara came when the Khartoum Arab slaves encroached them way back in the late 
                       19th Century.Gaze is a traditional dance of the Lugbara people. This youthful dance reflects the 
                       transition of the bodily movements into the style of their neighbors in the Congo and is spreading
                       across Uganda.</p></div>
